You may have the option to order delivery of alcohol products in some locations and from certain retailers. You agree that you will comply with all applicable laws and not cause WeMart, your Personal Shopper, or any retailer to contravene any applicable laws. You agree that you are of legal drinking age for purchasing, possessing, and consuming alcohol (i.e., 21 years of age or older in the United States). If you order alcohol products, you understand and acknowledge that neither WeMart nor a Personal Shopper can accept your order of alcohol products, and the order will only be delivered if the retailer accepts your order. You agree that, upon delivery of alcohol products, the recipient will provide valid government-issued identification proving their age to the Personal Shopper delivering the alcohol products and that the recipient will not be intoxicated when receiving delivery of such products. You agree that if any applicable legal requirements for the delivery of alcohol are not met, WeMart reserves the right to cancel the alcohol-related portion of your order.
