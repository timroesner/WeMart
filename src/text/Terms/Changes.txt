We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. When WeMart does so, WeMart will post the most current version of the Terms on WeMartâ€™s website and, if a revision to the Terms is material, WeMart will notify you of the new Terms (for example, by email or a notification on the Services). Changes to these terms will not apply retroactively. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you should discontinue your use of the Services.
